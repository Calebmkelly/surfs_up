# surfs_up

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

For this project, the use of programming tools will be implemented in order to thoroughly analyze the climate data in Oahu, with an emphasis on June and December. These programming tools include SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, the data provided from these tools can be utilized in order to pursue a location that fits the needs of a ice cream and surf shop. gathering the data from both June and December will help give an idea on the year round sustainability that each shop will have in accordance to their locations temperature range over the years

## Results:
figure 1: June Temperature Statistics

figure 2: December Temperature Statistics

figure 1 June Temps:
- Count: 1700
- Mean: 74.944
- Standard deviation: 3.257
- Minimum: 64
- 25 Percentile: 73
- 50 percentile: 75
- 75 percentile: 77
- Maximum: 85

figure 2 Dec Temps:
- Count: 1517
- Mean: 71.042
- Standard deviation: 3.746
- Minimum: 56
- 25 Percentile: 69 
- 50 percentile: 71
- 75 percentile: 74
- Maximum: 83

Above are the results in image form and in text. The data seems to differ in every aspect, taking a closer look at three components, Minimum, Average, and Maximum can elucidate a more clear idea as too wether or not the temperatures extracted are in a good range that suits a surf/ice cream shop. In Fahrenheit, June has a minimum temperature of 64 degrees, an average temperature of around 75 degrees, and a maximum temperature of 85 degrees. For the month of December, there is a minimum temperature of 56 degrees, an average temperature of around 71 degrees, and a maximum temperature of 83 degrees.

## Summary:


There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
